## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/) - Vue3 library
- [Tailwind Style Components](https://tailwind.com/) - For styles

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned
 Reactive state management with ref() and computed()
  - Component lifecycle - using onMounted() for client-side operations
  - Template conditionals - v-if, v-for, dynamic classes with :class
  - Event handling - @click for user interactions

#### Key Takeaway
  Sometimes the simplest solution is the best solution - I went from trying to implement a complex state management with external data fetching to chossing clean, static data that just works. I learned when to add complexity and when it's not neccessary.

### Continued development
  I'd like to improve on Debugging tactics on Nuxt App with focus on 
   - SSR/Hydration issues and cache invalidation
  - Import/auto-import troubles with composables and stores


### Useful resources

- [Your Navbar Should Know where it is]() - This helped me with making UI design decisions . I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
